Our first step in this project was to define the structure and define endpoints.

Installations so far:
- pip install requests (success)
- pip install Flask (success)
- pip install Flask-PyMongo (success)

Technologies:
- database: mongoDB
- bakend: python
- front-end: javascript, maybe with REACT framework (and html+css ofc)


Note:
When installing Flask, the modules 'request', 'jsonify' and 'abort' come bundled with it. They are part of Flasks core functionallity:
    - request: handles incomming HTTP requests
    - jsonify: creates JSON responses easily
    - abort: provides a way to raise HTTP exceptions (eg 404 or 403)
